# Meeting Prep - Thesis Advisor

## Context
I have a working VSS→AAOS HAL code generation pipeline using multi-agent LLMs.
Want to turn this into Master's thesis.

## Questions for Advisor

1. **Scope**: Is this topic appropriate for our program's Master's thesis?

2. **Timeline**: I have [X months] - is that realistic for this scope?

3. **Research vs Engineering**: How much pure research vs applied engineering is expected?

4. **Evaluation**: What level of experimental rigor do you expect?
   - Do I need human expert evaluation?
   - Are code metrics sufficient?
   - Should I aim for a publication?

5. **Resources**: Can you help connect me with:
   - Automotive software engineers for evaluation?
   - Computing resources for large-scale experiments?

6. **Feedback**: Based on my initial research questions, what would you change?

## Materials to Share
- Current system demo/output
- Initial research questions
- Preliminary metrics (84.6% LLM success rate)
